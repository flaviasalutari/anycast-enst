Results of a thorough validation campaign based on available ground truth (several DNS root servers and CDNs), using multiple measurement infrastructures (PlanetLab, RIPE), introduced in {% cite infocom15a %}, thorougly analyzed in {% cite jsac16 %} and exhaustively analyzed in {% cite techrep16 %}). The code and validation datasets we used in these publications are available below.

- We are planning to open the iGreedy GitHub soon
	- The code integrates with the new RIPE streaming APIs, if you want to beta-test please send us an email
- You can find [version 1.0 of iGreedy source code](http://goo.gl/7ESrCR), with which you can
	- reply our experiments on our collected dataset and groundtruth
	- generate and analyze new datasets over RIPE Atlas (provided you have an account and credits)
